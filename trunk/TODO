TODO File for tsnnls project (unordered)

1. Convert all of the direct f77blas calls in TAUCS into cblas_ calls,
in the interest of only using one BLAS interface in the entire
package, and avoiding the need to detect guess at FORTRAN name
mangling schemes for BLAS.

2. Encapsulate all of the LAPACK calls in TAUCS in a common header
which can be used to make changes in a single place if FORTRAN name
mangling changes.

3. Autoinstall of static "megamix" precompiled binary library if we
can't link with local BLAS/LAPACK.

4. Convert to BLOCK3 algorithm.
